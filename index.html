            <p>My name is Enid Maori Soto Paez. I was born September 10, 1983 in Venezuela. I always loved to draw since I was a kid, and I thought I was very good at it. Growing up I got more crafty; I learned about art history, drawing and painting techniques, and even a little bit of woodworking.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I decided I should take advantage of these creative traits, so I went to school and obtained a Bachelors in Graphic Design. This is what I currently do for a living and it has been going very well for many years. I also obtained a A.S. degree in web development in 2012, and I completed a very comprehensive programming bootcamp in 2020. I wanted to expand my skillset to keep up with market demand and to make myself more able to be creative in the digital world.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Today, my work focused in both graphic design and front-end development, which turns me into a well-rounded profesional and an asset for any company. This website showcases a few samples of my programming work. Please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> if you have any questions!</p>
